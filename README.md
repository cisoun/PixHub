PixHub is a free picture sharing community platform. It was made by two students from the HE-Arc engineering school of NeuchÃ¢tel (Switzerland).

PixHub's goal is to offer you, a simple and nice platform to share your pictures with a community. Run the server, manage it and let your visitors upload their creations.

## Deployment

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cisoun/PixHub
cd PixHub
composer update
```

### Configuration

#### Upload folder

Create the upload folder where PixHub will put the uploaded pictures.

```bash
mkdir public/uploads
```

#### Permission

Some permissions will be required to allow PixHub to write in the folders.

```bash
chmod 777 -r app/storage
chmod 777 -r public/uploads
```

#### Database

Add your database identifiers in app/config/database.php and choose which database connection you will use.
For example, if you use MySQL, just modify the "default" value.

```
'default' => 'mysql',
```

#### reCAPTCHA
You must add your reCAPTCHA API key in order to use the sign up page. Go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#list and create your keys.

When it's done, add them to PixHub/app/config/packages/greggilbert/recaptcha/config.php.

#### Upload limits

In most cases, PHP is defined to accept files which have a size up to 2 Mo. You can change the limits in php.ini.
Look for "upload_max_filesize" and set the file size limit you wish.

```bash
upload_max_filesize = 10M
```

### Running PixHub

On the new directory, simply execute

```bash
php artisan serve
```
